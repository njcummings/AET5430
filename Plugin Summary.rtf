\f0\fs24 \cf0 The goal of this software is to create a Chorus/Reverb Plugin. The user should be able to control the length of reverb and Dry vs. Wet signal. Additionally, the user should be able to control the amount of chorus effect they want through the rate, depth, and have the ability to alter the phase. Furthermore, the chorus will also have control over the amount of Dry vs. Wet signal. Finally, there will be a set gain that the user won\'92t have control over.}
